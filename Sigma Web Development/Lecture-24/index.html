      1. What are the main components of a CPU? (2 marks) 
      Ans:A CPU (Central
      Processing Unit) has three main components: ● Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):
      Performs all arithmetic (add, subtract) and logical (AND, OR, NOT)
      operations. ● Control Unit (CU): Directs the operation of the processor by
      generating control and timing signals. ● Registers: Small, high-speed
      storage locations used to hold data and instructions temporarily. 2. State
      the function of the Program Counter (PC) and the Instruction Register
      (IR). (2 marks) ● The Program Counter (PC) holds the memory address of the
      next instruction to be fetched for execution. ● The Instruction Register
      (IR) holds the current instruction that has been fetched and is being
      decoded and executed. 3. Differentiate between MAR and MDR. (2 marks) The
      Memory Address Register (MAR) holds the memory address of the location to
      be accessed (read from or written to). The Memory Data Register (MDR)
      holds the actual data that is being transferred to or from that memory
      location. 4. What is an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)? (2 marks) An
      ISA is the part of the computer architecture that is visible to the
      programmer. It acts as the interface between the hardware and the
      software, defining the set of all instructions, registers, addressing
      modes, and data types that the processor can execute. 5. Explain the Fetch
      cycle using Register Transfer Language (RTL). (3 marks) The Fetch cycle
      retrieves an instruction from memory. The steps in RTL are: ● T0 :MAR←[PC]
      (Copy PC content to MAR) ● T1 :MDR←M[MAR],PC←[PC]+1 (Fetch from memory,
      increment PC) ● T2 :IR←[MDR] (Move instruction to IR)
